# M&L restaurant

## Meta course on Coursera platform

Students have to create a static page for a chosen project, in order to graduate from the course provided by Meta at the Coursera platform.

I've chosen to create a simple restaurant home page, includes a main navigation, hero, menu, contact and footer section.

No CSS library was used, but vanilla.

Fontawesome was used, to include some icons

### Note: 

External images were included, and have not been modified by me. Many thanks to their owners.

Gladly, have a look on the finished project's screenshots :)

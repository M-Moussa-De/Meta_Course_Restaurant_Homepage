# M&L restaurant

## Meta course on Coursera platform

Students have to create a static page for a chosen project, in order to graduate from the course provided by Meta at the Coursera platform.

I've chosen to create a simple restaurant home page, includes a main navigation, hero, menu, contact and footer section.

Gladly, have a look on the attached screenshots :)
